Functionality:
CalcKit is a program that is designed to help teach students the basics of fundamental concepts in Calculus. CalcKit will have three main functionalities. The first will be its ability to add and subtract vectors. Vectors can be a confusing topic for some students, as they may have trouble visualising the vector components graphically. Therefore, CalcKit’s ability to not just perform basic operations on vectors, but also show the vectors graphically, may aid in the students’ understanding of this concept. Additionally, CalcKit will have the ability calculate the derivative of polynomial functions.  For most, derivatives can be a confusing and challenging topic, and a strong foundation in derivatives is needed to do well in any Calculus class. Therefore, CalcKit will provide step by step calculations of derivatives in order to ensure the user understands the process of deriving a function.
